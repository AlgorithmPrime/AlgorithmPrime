# Cryptanalysis Frequency Explorer (Educational)

This project presents a conceptual Python script that emulates the exploratory behavior of a cryptanalysis tool using a custom mathematical algorithm based on number theory. Specifically, it analyzes integers of the form `6n ± 1` and attempts to identify structural patterns that can suggest factorization, using cyclical functions and collision detection.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This tool is intended **solely for educational purposes**. While it demonstrates an original approach to prime factor detection through algorithmic analysis, it is **not optimized** for production cryptographic applications. However, with further research and refinement, it may inspire future techniques in computational number theory or cryptanalysis.

## Overview

The script `Cryptanalisis.py` defines a function called `explore_frequencies(X)`, which:
- Accepts an integer `X` in the form `6n ± 1`.
- Computes three cyclic functions (`f1`, `f2`, and `f3`) for values of `c`.
- Detects a **collision** between derived values and the target structure.
- Identifies potential factors if such a collision is found.

If successful, the script prints the detected factors of `X`. If not, it suggests whether `X` may be prime based on the absence of early collisions.

## How it Works

- The logic behind the script is inspired by frequency patterns and modular arithmetic.
- It mimics how one might approach pattern-based weaknesses in RSA-like systems, where the structure of composite numbers can sometimes be exploited.
- The approach uses:
  - A reduced search space (only numbers of the form `6n ± 1` are considered).
  - Early exits upon detecting the first "collision" that implies a factorization.

## Usage

To run the script:

```bash
python Cryptanalisis.py
